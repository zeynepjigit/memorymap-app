## AI-Powered Diary to Memory Map Application

## 1. Problem / Opportunity

### Detailed Product Description and In-Depth Problem Analysis

The AI-Powered Diary to Memory Map Application is an innovative digital platform that enriches users' daily life experiences not just as text, but multidimensionally with emotional states, visited places, and AI-powered visuals.

Today's widespread traditional diary applications are text-based and cannot effectively support the emotional intensity, spatial relationships, and personal development context of users' experiences. This creates a significant gap in terms of users' emotional awareness and memory retention of their experiences. Users mostly store their text entries with timestamps in plain lists, which leads to difficulties in contextualizing and visualizing past memories.

The project aims to solve this problem through AI-based emotion analysis, location extraction, and visual content generation, providing a comprehensive platform where users can track their memories on maps with visual and emotional context, while also contributing to their personal development through GPT-4 supported reflective questions.

This innovative approach both supports individual mental health and creates a competitive advantage in the current market by enabling users to record and discover their memories in a multidimensional way.

## 2. Target Users & Use Cases

### Target User Profiles

- **Individual Diary Enthusiasts:** Users of all age groups who want to record their lived experiences in a more meaningful, rich, and lasting way.
- **Personal Development and Mental Health Enthusiasts:** Students, professionals, and consultees who want to develop awareness by regularly tracking their emotions and improve their psychological health.
- **Travel and Exploration Enthusiasts:** Travelers and travel lovers who want to record their travel experiences in a spatial context.
- **Technology & Data Enthusiasts:** Advanced users who want to gain insights by performing emotion-location analyses on their own datasets.

### Core Use Cases

- Creating enriched memories from daily text entries through automatic emotion and location extraction.
- Visualizing visited places and memories on interactive maps based on OpenStreetMap.
- Generating AI-powered original visuals suitable for diary content and presenting them in gallery format.
- Providing reflective questions and motivational notifications to users through GPT-4 based personal development coaching module.
- Analyzing and reporting memories based on date and location to users.

## 3. Current State / User Journeys and Competition

Currently, digital diary applications (Day One, Journey, etc.) and map applications (Google Maps, Mapbox) are used separately. These applications do not handle the user experience holistically and do not allow for establishing emotion-location relationships. Additionally, AI-powered personal development coaching integration is rarely found.

Competitive products generally include text-based input and limited emotion analysis, but comprehensive visual generation and spatial integration are lacking. This limits users' personal data richness and interaction.

Our project aims to fill this gap with AI-based multidimensional data analysis and user experience.
